    `python3 manage.py startapp blog`

3. hook up url mapper for homepage@website/project level
    defer application-level url-mapping to applications
    define static file path for development (deploy in production will use different mechanism)

4. local run
    4.1 update migrations whenever any model changes
`python3 manage.py makemigrations`
`python3 manage.py migrate`
`python3 manage.py runserver`
