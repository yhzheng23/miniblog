'model-view-url'
url: map request to view
view: decide what data is generated by which model, and is rendered by which template

I initial setup
1. start skeleton project
    `django-admin startproject miniblog`

2. create application & register application@settings.py
    `python3 manage.py startapp blog`

3. hook up url mapper for homepage@website/project level
    defer application-level url-mapping to applications
    define static file path for development (deploy in production will use different mechanism)

4. local run
    4.1 update migrations whenever any model changes
`python3 manage.py makemigrations`
`python3 manage.py migrate`
`python3 manage.py runserver`
now the server should be up; and homepage [http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/) is up but no content

II homepage
5. model design: blog, comment, blogger(based on 'User')
6. index page 

III admin pages
7. superuser to add/edit/delete model instances
    add a few blogs, bloggers for test.  

IV basic pages
8. blog list, blog detail, blogger detail
    use class-based list view and detail view to handle views.py

V login related
9. use django out-of-box authentication mechanism
10. use modelform or generic-editing-views to handle create/update/delete blogs, comments with user input.

issues:
1. add comments
2. how to create user/blogger from website, instead of admin page
